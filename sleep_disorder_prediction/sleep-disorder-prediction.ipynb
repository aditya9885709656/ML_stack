I then selected relevant features for predicting sleep disorders.\n\n#### Handling Imbalanced Data: \nI noticed a class imbalance in the target variable 'Sleep Disorder'. To handle this, I used Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to create a balanced dataset by oversampling the minority class. This made the model more capable of distinguishing between different classes.\n\n#### Model Selection & Training: \nI chose to use the Random Forest Classifier due to its robustness and versatility. This model was trained on the resampled dataset.\n\n#### Model Evaluation: \nI used the standard train-test-split approach for validating the model. The model's predictions were evaluated based on the accuracy achieved on the test dataset.\n\n#### Saving the Model: \nI serialized the trained model using joblib, allowing it to be saved to a file and then reloaded later. This is an important step for deploying the model.\n\n#### Creating an Interactive Predictive Tool: \nI created a simple, interactive tool using the ipywidgets library. This tool allows a user to input their personal data, and then it uses the trained model to predict whether the user is likely to have a sleep disorder.\n\nWhile I didn't deploy this model as a web application or dive deep into model interpretability for this project, these are potential next steps that could be taken. These additional steps would allow me to showcase more skills in machine learning engineering and explain the decision-making process of the model, respectively.\n\nThroughout this process, I was able to apply and demonstrate skills in various important areas of a machine learning project, including data preprocessing, handling imbalanced datasets, model selection and training, and creating an interactive tool for making predictions.","metadata":{"id":"Q27MUJcVsIXG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Dataset and
