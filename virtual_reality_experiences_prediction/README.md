The dataset consists of user experiences in virtual reality (VR) environments. It includes data related to physiological responses, such as heart rate and skin conductance, emotional states, and user preferences. The purpose of the dataset is to enhance VR technology by analyzing user experiences. This analysis aims to improve VR design, user comfort, and customization by understanding how users physiologically and emotionally respond to different VR environments. The dataset enables developers to optimize VR systems and create tailored experiences to enhance immersion and overall user satisfaction.

    User ID: This variable represents a unique identifier for each user participating in the VR experience. It assigns a distinct ID to each user to differentiate their data in the dataset.

    Age: This variable captures the age of the user who participated in the VR experience. It represents the user's age at the time of the VR experience and can be an integer value.

    Gender: This variable denotes the gender of the user. It can have categories such as 'Male', 'Female', or 'Other', representing the gender identity of the user.

    VR Headset Type: This variable specifies the type of VR headset used by the user during the VR experience. It can include options like 'Oculus Rift', 'HTC Vive', 'PlayStation VR', or other types of VR headsets.

    Duration: This variable represents the duration of the VR experience in minutes. It captures the length of time the user spent engaged in the virtual reality environment.

    Motion Sickness Rating: This variable indicates the user's self-reported rating of motion sickness experienced during the VR experience. It can be on a scale of 1 to 10, with higher values indicating a higher level of motion sickness.

Dependent Variable:

    Immersion Level: This variable measures how immersed the user felt during the VR experience. It represents the subjective level of immersion reported by the user and can be measured on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 indicating the highest level of immersion.
