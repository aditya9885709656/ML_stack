The differential diagnosis of "erythemato-squamous" diseases is a real problem in dermatology. They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling, with minimal differences. The disorders in this group are psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, chronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Usually, a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis, but unfortunately, these diseases share many histopathological features as well.

Patients were first evaluated clinically with 12 features. Afterward, skin samples were taken for the evaluation of 22 histopathological features. The values of the histopathological features are determined by an analysis of the samples under a microscope

Feature Value Information
In the dataset constructed for this domain, the family history feature has the value 1 if any of these diseases has been observed in the family, and 0 otherwise. The age feature simply represents the age of the patient.

Every other feature clinical and histopathological was given a degree in the range of 0 to 3. Here, 0 indicates that the feature was not present, 3 indicates the largest amount possible, and 1, 2 indicate the relative intermediate values.
