The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious football tournament in the world. The championship has been awarded every four years since the start of the tournament in 1930.

The current format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams quality for the tournament. In the tournament, 32 teams, including the host nation, compete for the title at different stadiums in the host country.

The reigning champion is France, which beat Croatia in the 2018 tournament in Russia. Qatar will host the 2022 tournament, for which the first match will be played in November.
