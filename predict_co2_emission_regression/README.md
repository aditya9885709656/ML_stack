Dataset We will be using a dataset that encapsulates the carbon dioxide emissions generated from burning coal for producing electricity power in the United States of America between 1973 and 2016. Using XGBoost, we will try to predict the carbon dioxide emissions in jupyter notebook for the next few years.
